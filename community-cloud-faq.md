# Operate First community cloud FAQ

## What is happening to the Operate First community cloud?

The project is shutting down this community cloud instance, decommissioning or returning community clusters to their provider.

The engineers responsible for maintaining the infrastructure supporting the Operate First community cloud have undergone a shift in their responsibilities, which has led to a decision to power down the OpenShift clusters and the supporting infrastructure behind the Operate First community cloud.
The shutdown is scheduled for April 15, 2023. 

## To be clear, what exactly **is** the Operate First community cloud?

The Operate First community cloud is a shared environment for Open Source projects and SRE practicioners.
It's been operated under a community service level expectation (SLE) to be as open and transparent as possible.

## What is the Operate First project without the community cloud?

The Operate First project is a [community of practice (CoP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) that has been co-developing an Open Cloud implementation as a living reference model of principles and a laboratory of practices.

To this point, we have opted to maintain a set of community clusters as the "Operate First community cloud".
Going forward, the project will look to draw practitioners to Operate First through collaboration with other community clusters and community clouds of particular projects or organizations.

Operate First has been and remains a CoP comprised of developers, operators, and others — site reliability engineers (SRE), data scientists, University researchers, Open Source practitioners, and so forth — who believe in promoting this Open approach to operations.
